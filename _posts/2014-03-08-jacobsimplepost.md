title: Jacob's Simple Blog Post

Getting my blog up was a bit challenging, but after playing around with it for a while, I finally figured it out. I was initially running into challenges because I didn’t understand the github pushes and pulls or the commit process fully. I tried committing the post without adding it. After typing git status; git add .; and git commit -m dozens of times, I think I have the hang of it. 

I also had a little trouble with the difference between the local version of the app that nitrous was displaying the version that heroku was displaying, but i think I have a handle on this now,

Here is a link to my Heroku app: http://jacobapp.herokuapp.com/edit/1

I didn’t do much with the blog. Basically, I just made a post and changed the background color to blue and then back to white.
