It was very funny for working together with partner. we got a better understanding how the linux command and github works. But there are still some other questions left. Such as: Why we should create different branch to submit assignment? 

This was a nice exercise to get us used to using new branches in our assignments. While the assignment seemed pretty simple, it got a bit frustrating due to connectivity issues with nitrous (and here we see clearly one of the disadvantages of cloud computing). It was nice to work in pairs though, as I was still able to get some experience with creating branches and committing changes for Maoxuxiang's part, and I was also able to get in some more experience with using github directly. I have to say, it was a lot easier using github for this assignment than nitrous, but I can see how it would be incredibly confusing if these were much larger projects.
