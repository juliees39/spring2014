##Reflections

We ran into some difficulties during the course of this assignment. When we pushed our final files with the updated statistics, we came across a merge conflict. This might have been because we both worked on the files at the same time without pulling before making new changes once we got to step 2. Otherwise, Github seems to definitely be a useful tool for collaboration; it will just require more practice so that we can better get used to the workflow. It is encouraging that despite the errors and problems, we were able to easily resolve them without losing our work.
