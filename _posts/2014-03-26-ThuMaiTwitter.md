This week's exercise let me know that APIs aren't scary.  Good thing, because for my final project, I eventually want to get our metadata tool talking to the Odum Institute data repository via an API.  No sweat!  Of course, it won't be as straightfoward as this Twitter API, but I know I don't have to be (completely) intimidated.

Check out my Twitter post via command line:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>I&#39;m learning how to command-line tweet! <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23gititgurl&amp;src=hash">#gititgurl</a></p>&mdash; Thu-Mai Christian (@tl_christian) <a href="https://twitter.com/tl_christian/statuses/448867238733701121">March 26, 2014</a></blockquote>

Sweet!...er, Tweet!
