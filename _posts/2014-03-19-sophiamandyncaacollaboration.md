title: Sophia & Mandy's NCAA Github Collaboration
---

##Collaboration Experience

We first discussed what we thought the process would entail after reading the instructions including how to make our branches, adding the labels to the appropriate files, etc.
Next, Sophia was able to successfully modify the Virginia file to allow Mandy to put in the data under a newly created UVA branch and pushed these commits. Mandy's Nitrious
stopped working so then we completed the assignement in Github where she created an Oklahoma branch and edited the Oklahoma file. We then added the data to our approriate files 
and did our pull requests. We both then reviewed each other's pull requests, tagged them with milestones, and merged the requests. Then we deleted the branches. It was helpful
to talk out this process and see it from both the Nitrous and Github sides. And it helped clarify how the collaboration process actually takes place in Github. Hooray Collaboration!
