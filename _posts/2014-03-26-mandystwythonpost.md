#My Twython Experience

For this assignment, we were required to clone tweethack and then use twython to tweet from command line to an online Twitter account.
I do not use Twitter, so I had to use the silshack twitter account for this assignment. Tweethack was quite simple to use and tweeting was easy.

It was great to see the backend of the program and dig into the code a bit via the tweethack.py file. I was able to read through the code and understand what it meant. (Pretty exciting!)

I'm really not a big Twitter person, so I honestly cannot see this being too useful for me in terms of 'tweeting'. That being said, reviewing the code and playing with it is definitely beneficial to increasing my confidence level and programming experience.

#Here is my tweet:
