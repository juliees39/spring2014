## Tweeting from the Command line

Tweeting, hacker style.  We'll work on this in class and it's due Friday.

## Projects

We've got about a month left.  Time for projects!

* Form groups
* Create your repo
* Add your link

At the end of the semester you'll turn in a Github repo and a writeup.  Milestones and well documented issues and code are key to success!
