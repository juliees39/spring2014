From your Nitrous box, clone the repo and install twython

```
git clone https://github.com/silshack/tweethack.git
pip install --user twython
```

Then:

* Create a creds.py file and put in the keys I'll give you in class.
* Run setup.py.  You can either be logged in to your personal twitter account or the class account.
* Run tweethack.py

Make sure to `cd` into the directory before you try to run the programs.

## What to turn in:

A pull requested post with a command line tweet you made [embedded](https://support.twitter.com/articles/20169559-embedding-a-tweet-on-your-website-or-blog) in it.  

## Extra credit: make your own twitter app.
Sign up at developer.twitter.com.  Make an app:
![make app](http://main.makeuseoflimited.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/new-twitter-app.jpg)

You'll find your own secrets:
![secrets](http://main.makeuseoflimited.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/twitter-app.jpg)

Get write access:
![read and write](http://main.makeuseoflimited.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/readwrite-access.jpg)

Link your own twitter account:
![access token](http://main.makeuseoflimited.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/access-token.jpg)

For this extra credit, turn in a post detailing how I can tweet from your app.  I'll need access to your secret keys and it's very important to not commit them to a github repo.  `.gitignore` any files containing secrets the way we've done in class.
