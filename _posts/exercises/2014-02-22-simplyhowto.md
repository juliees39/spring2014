Hi Guys! Today we're going to make a blog on Heroku.

## First: Nitrous Keys

First, in Nitrous, go to Boxes, select your box and click Reveal Public Key. This lets us access a secure encryption key we will find useful later. You should also click Add to GitHub which will share that key with GitHub and make things just a little bit easier.

Public/private key encription lets you forego a password when using git if you choose to.  One of the tools we use below requires it, but you can now start using the ssh clone link from within Nitrous if you like.

## Review

```bash
cd      # change directories - this is how you move around
pwd     # print working directory - this shows you where you are
ls      # list contents of working directorys - this shows you what's here
```

## Let's Go!
OK let's get going.  You'll find the rest of the instructions on a blog I have deployed to Heroku- just like the one you'll make!  See it [here](http://silshack-simple1.herokuapp.com/)

# Your assignment
A post, on Github, with a pull request into [silshack/spring2014](https://github.com/silshack/spring2014) with the following:  

1. A link to your Heroku app running Simple, with at least one post  

2. A brief description of the process of getting your instance of Simple onto Heroku  

3. Something cool you did to Simple, the relevant source code and a description. The cooler the better.
