I made my first post on SimpleHack. It's nothing much, as you'd expect for a first post. You can find my post at [this link](http://silshack-zbay.herokuapp.com/). 


As I understand it, I executed some scripts that set up a blogging application on top of a database in a cloud environment. At first, I thought that I had to code within simple.py in order to make a post. This seemed a far from simple task, and required some serious code comprehension. More careful reading of the _instructions_, however, clarified that I merely had to log in as an admin to make a post. What a relief!
Truth be told, I'm fuzzy on how Heroku works. I'm sure I'll figure it out as we work on it in through class.
