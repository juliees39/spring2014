Here is my blog: http://silshack-agooch.herokuapp.com/. It isn't much, but it's functional. 

As for my process, I can honestly say I was doing very well until getting to the ./setupenv1.sh portion of the exercise. Since it was busted, I was unable to finish my assignment in class. This meant I had to pick up from where I left off, but I ran into more issues when Nitrous kept giving me errors. 

I decided to just scrap everything and start over, because it was getting frustrating. After this, my code worked perfectly and I was able to push everything through to the heroku master. 

I will freely admit that it took me a bit to figure out where to go from there. I went into the simple.py file, but was not sure what I was supposed to do. Anyway, I realized at some point that I needed to checkout my actual app page. I went there and added the /admin to the URL to log in. 

The interface is really simple, so it was pretty easy to figure out. I created a basic post and used the drag and drop feature to add a picture that was sitting on my work computer. 

As for the bonus section, well, I didn't really want to mess up the app's layout too badly, so all I did was edit some of the colors in the layout.css file. I also added an image to the 404 template that I found on Google. Nothing too big, but it was nice to see the edits reflected in my page after pushing them through Nitrous. 

Note: I did have an issue at one point when editing. I changed some colors to the CSS layout page and pushed it through. When I went back to my blog the image of my dog was no longer visible. I'm not sure why this happened and couldn't find anything in my code, so I just deleted the post and created another one. 

I got my color codes here: http://www.huecode.com/

Here is the 404 image:
