title: Working with Grant
---

For this exercise, I had to opportunity to work with Grant. Since he was running around the room while I wrote this, this is the babykav speaking. 

Here is the link to the added NCSU file: https://github.com/silshack/NCAA/pull/26
Here is the link to the added St. Louis file: https://github.com/silshack/NCAA/pull/21

Working with Grant wasn't too bad haha. He seemed to know what he was doing. He also seemed a little distracted. Apparently he's popular in this class. One thing I did have an issue with was the fact that I didn't know which pull request to close. So I closed both of them. Both had the information that was needed. So I just went ahead and closed them both and deleted the branch. Grant said it was okay...so I guess that's okay.
