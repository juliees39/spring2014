This is my Heroku Blog: http://silshack-maoxuxiang.herokuapp.com/

I met some prolem when I set up this blog. For example: after I finished all the step showed on the smartypants' blog. My blog 
still can't show up. So I followed the "Trouble" instruction and finally it works!! 

I like play basketball so I made my first post about my favorite basketball team:  San Antonio Spurs. I uploaded my blog's background picture.
So I edit the layout.html file and the code is like this:

```
body {
            background-image:url(http://i.imgur.com/BXUQanI.jpg?1);
                     }
```

I found if I want to make my blog more beautiful I need study more knwledge about HTML and CSS. I will keep searching these information.
In sum, setting up a personal blog is a very funny and useful process for me. I enjoyed it!!
