#The  Class
We learned about API's by using one for Twitter. API's make a lot more sense to me now, now that I've actually used on (instead of just seeing the term thrown around). It's really cool to be able to do 'extra' stuff from the command line.


#The Twitter
I made a shiny Twitter account for this assignment (and I'll probably never use it again, who knows?)


#The Tweet
Here is my embedded tweet (tweet tweet?)
