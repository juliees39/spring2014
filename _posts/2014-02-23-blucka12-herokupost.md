title: Narcissism and the "Selfie"

I am really enjoying tooling around with Nitrous and this Heroku app is pretty cool!

Here's my post:

The thing that I am curious to figure, though, is how to resize the pics that I upload to Heroku. I'd like to have the option to resize and choose the location of where the images appear. I'll be looking into that...
