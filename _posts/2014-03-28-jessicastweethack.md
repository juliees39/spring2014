###My Tweethack

This was a cool little exercise! I have messed around with the twitter api a little bit, but it was very interesting being able to
use it from the backend. It's great to see what python can do with something that many of us use every day!

Here's my tweet!

No clue what&#39;s going on.</p>&mdash; Skaa F (@jskaa_f) <a href="https://twitter.com/jskaa_f/statuses/448867606913908736">March 26, 2014</a></blockquote>
