## Reflection
 
 Well, in general, it is simple. However, it is a little bit trickly for us to understand what this assignment is about. Because 
 we spent some time to figure out the job distribution among the pairs. However, once we understood the request, it was fairly easy.
 Beside, we used to play with Subversion, which is another version control system. It has some similar founctions, but today we find
 out that github is more useful. With Subversion, you have a problem. To be specific, the SVN repository may be in a location you can't reach , then you cannot commit. If you want to make a copy of your code, you have to literally copy/paste it.
 With Git, you do not have this problem. Your local copy is a repository, and you can commit to it and get all benefits of source control. When you regain connectivity to the main repository, you can commit against it.
 
 Overall, Github has a lot of founctions, except pull request and issue. In the following classes, we hope to learn more about Github.
