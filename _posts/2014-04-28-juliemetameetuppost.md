title: Julie's Meet Up Reflection Post

Overall, I enjoyed going to the meet-ups. I have to say, I was surprised by how welcoming the people were. For some reason, I was afraid they were going to quiz me on python when I walked in, and I was afraid they wouldn’t be welcoming to somehow who didn’t know very much about programming. However, that was not true. People at the meet-ups had all different skill levels when it came to programming, and everyone was always very welcoming. I guess it makes sense that they would be - after all, they want people to come to their meetings. If people stopped coming, their group would cease to exist. But also, I think most people are generally nice and welcoming.

My favorite meet-up was the Tripython one I attended recently. I liked learning about something new - ParaView. I had no idea that applications like that one existed. Also, as I said in my write-up for the meet-up, I liked hearing about all the different jobs people had and how they used Python in  their work and/or hobbies. I was especially interested in hearing more about how one of the members use python in his work of the UNC Marine Science department. However, I didn’t really get a chance to talk to him at the meet-up, and I don’t think I’ll be able to go to another meeting because I am leaving Chapel Hill in just a few weeks. Alas!

I also enjoyed the Girl Develop It meet up. The people there were really welcoming. There was one girl there who had just decided to start teaching herself python. I thought that was pretty cool.  The only thing I didn’t like about it was that there was no activity, like how at the TriPython group we learned about ParaView. At the Girl Develop It meeting I went to, we were just hanging out and talking, which was fun, but when I first got there, I wasn’t sure was going on. I guess I just like structure.

I have to say, I wasn’t thrilled with the WordPress group meetup. The people were very welcoming, but the subject matter wasn’t all that interesting to me. 

Going to all these meet-ups, it was also interesting to see the over-laps between groups. That is, there were people in one group who were also in another, or who worked with someone from one group, or knew someone. For example, everywhere I went, someone in our group seemed to know our instructor, Elliot. (Well, except for the WordPress group.) Also, Julia, one of the co-leaders of the Girl Develop It Group, used to work at Caktus, where the TriPython meet-up was held, and she also knows our instructor, Elliot. There seems to be a lot of inter-connectedness going on.

It was also really nice to see how willing people were to help others with their projects, or help them learn more about coding. I think I would consider going to another meet-up, in whatever city I end up in after Chapel Hill.
