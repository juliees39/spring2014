##Chunxi's First Simple Hack##

Here is the link : http://silshack-lanblue.herokuapp.com/

In general, it is not very hard. But it did take some time. The first problem is after I typing all the codes on the nitrous,
it still failed. But after Grant update the guide, I typed the code in trouble part and it worked.
Another problem I faced in building my blog is when I was configuring my blog, I pressed "enter" to accept all the defaults. Therefore, my page did not have email, github or even title. It worked, well, but not what I expected. So I could only get back to the nitrous, changed the configure and pushed it again. It is a little bit hard. Because I do not
know whether this sentence is neccessary or not.  It teaches me a leason. I should think more before I entered.

When I successfully opened my blog, it took me some time to think about how to edit it. Finally, I decided to describe my hometown.
I found some description and pictures from Wikipedia. Then I thought it may be too simple. So I decided to embed the google map as the video taught. But it seems like my google map is a different version.I cannot achieve it as the video did. Therefore, I found another guide on the web which taught me how to embed google map on the page.  https://support.google.com/maps/answer/72644?hl=en

It seems like there are a lot of cool things which can be achieved on the simplehack. But it will take me some time to learn more, read more.
