**Libby**: Working together went well, Yonghao and I have worked on other class projects together, and we are a good team.

**Yonghao**: Libby and I once worked together about other class's project. It's cool! That's all

**Libby**: He sure does have a way with words. Also, I hope that we get this GitHub stuff figured out before we begin heavy work on our final project.

**Yonghao**: We work together, she helps me a lot. I am sure we can make our final project awesome.
