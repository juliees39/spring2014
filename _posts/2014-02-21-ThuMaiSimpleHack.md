This week was an interesting exercise in the mechanics of pushes and pulls.  I am a very visual person, so I'm glad that Elliott provided diagrams explaining how data get moved between our individual repositories to the primary class site.  It helped me tremendously in understanding what this git business is all about.  Thanks for that.

After Grant's on-the-fly debugging, I was able to easily go through the process of setting up my instance of Simple onto Heroku.  Simple it is. I checked out the .css files to see if I could hack the layout and make pretty colors and fonts. I was able to make some color changes by playing with the code below in the layout.css file:

```
body {
    background: #fff;
    color: #222;
}
```

I quickly realized that this defeats the purpose of the whole Simple layout concept.  Minimalism it is.  (Though at the same time, I am digging what Katie did with her Simple blog--a nice balance of minimalism *and* style.)

I also have to point out that tech folks have awfully good customer service.  I had some issues with my nitrous.io box hanging up.  Apparently, there was a huge traffic surge in our area at the time, which likely caused my box to be unable to connect for a while.  All was well just a few minutes after I sent them a note. Very cool. 

And [here is my first Simple Blog post](http://silshack-tlchristian.herokuapp.com/).  Kids and iPhoto are hilarious!
