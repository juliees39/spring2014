title: Sophia's Tweet from Command Line
---

For this class we learned how to use the twython API to tweet from the command line. This exercise was useful for 
showing me how you can use an API to interface with another platform. It was also helpful to hear Elliot walk through
the code he wrote and how to change the code based on the programmer's needs.
