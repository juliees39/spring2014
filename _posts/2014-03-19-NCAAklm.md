## Katie (Louisville) and Laura (Kentucky)

We each cloned the original NCAA repo, and each created a file for the other's team on a branch with the team's name. 
We pushed the branches to the silshack repo, then each pulled down our respective teams' branches. We had a bit of
difficulty finding the stats we needed, but with ESPN and Wikipedia we eventually tracked them down. Then we each
pushed our changed files with the new stats to GitHub, submitted our pull requests for our branches, and then checked
& merged each other's requests.
